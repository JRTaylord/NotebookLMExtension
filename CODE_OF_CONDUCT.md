# Code of Conduct

Our community has always worked to be a welcoming and respectful community, and we want to ensure that doesn't change as we grow and evolve. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:

- be friendly and patient,
- be welcoming,
- be considerate,
- be respectful,
- be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others,
- when we disagree, try to understand why.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community.

## Our Standards

**Be friendly and patient.**

**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

**Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.

**Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others.** Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Discriminatory jokes and language
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing")
- Personal insults
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop

**When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

## Reporting

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report it by opening a private issue. Maintainers may remove participants who engage in unacceptable behavior.
